\title{Relative abundances in phyloseq object}
\usage{
calc_relative_abunance(ps)
}
\arguments{
\item{ps}{a whole phyloseq object of taxonomic produced by the phyloseq::phyloseq() function.
ps is named thus as this is common shorthand for a phyloseq object in the field.}
}
\value{
an R dataframe of microbiome composition data containing sample ID and all other
provided metadata, taxonomic information, abundance values, and relative abundance values.
Abundance values of NA are dropped.
}
\description{
Starting from a phyloseq object, this applies the psmelt function to convert data into an R dataframe and subsequently calculate relative abundance of each taxonomic unit within its sample.
